## layer 1, understand strides and kernel_size concepts, we do not freeze the layers i think? maybe if there is overfitting we can freeze resnet for less training parameters

# In higher layers of the network, detailed pixel information is lost whilethe high level content of the image is preserved. Clear Explanation is here(https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/30038/why-do-we-lose-detail-of-an-image-as-we-go-deeper-into-a-convnet)
